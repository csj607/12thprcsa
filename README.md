### Science Rationale

This conference is the 12th in the Pacific Rim Conference Series on Stellar Astrophysics. Since 1980s, the Pacific Rim Conference Series has played an important role in sharing recent research works on observation data and theoretical modeling, discussing many new results and planning for future collaboration in the field of stellar astrophysics. In 2015, Hong Kong hosted the 11th meeting and the subsequent meeting has been postponed due to the Covid19 pandemic. There have been many new discoveries regarding gravitational radiation from compact binaries, extrasolar planets, and star formation with the remarkable technological advancement represented by LIGO, GAIA, ALMA and JWST to name a few. We hope that this conference will provide an opportunity to reinforce networking and promote advancement in research on stellar astrophysics.

This conference will cover a broad range of topics including the following but not limited to

Binary Stars

Star Formation

Stellar Atmosphere and Evolution

Stellar Systems and Populations

Extrasolar Planets

Planetary Nebulae and Symbiotic Stars

Compact Objects and High Energy Phenomena

Stellar Transients​

We welcome your participation to present your research findings, interesting ideas and proposal for future collaborations.
